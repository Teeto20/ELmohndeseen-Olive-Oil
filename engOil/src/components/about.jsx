        About Us:
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-2 dark:text-gray-300">
        We are a company dedicated to providing the best olive oil products.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 italic mb-2 dark:text-gray-300">
        Alhamdulillah, Al MOHANDISSEN olive oil is distinguished by the clarity of
        the four quality signs as follows:
      </p>
      <ol className="text-gray-600 pl-5 space-y-2 dark:text-gray-300">
        <li>
          <strong>First:</strong> The smell of olive fruit, which is completely
          clear when opening the sealed container...
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Second:</strong> Olive sediment suspended in the oil due to
          weekly pressing, which is strong evidence that the oil is fresh.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third:</strong> The sensation of pungency and acceptable
          bitterness at the back of the tongue when swallowing, which is very
          appealing to some people...
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fourth:</strong> Refrigeration test: a quantity of oil 1 cm
          thick is placed in a glass cup and put in the refrigerator outside the
          freezer for 24 hours, it will solidify 100%, like the
          attachedÂ picture...
